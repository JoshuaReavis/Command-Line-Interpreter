# Command-Line-Interpreter
Command Line Interpreter, written in C, which can run any Unix command or utility and any program which is accessible, similiar to Bash. CLI.c contains the main, and thus should be the program run in the terminal. All other auxiliary programs are called from within CLI.c in some manner.

I have written all files for this project with the exception of the ttymode and regexp .c and header files.
